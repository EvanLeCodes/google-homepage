The Odin Project HTML/CSS Project

I will be reconstructing the Google Homepage using WebDev tools in Chrome. It will be a simple version that consists of just a search box.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Update 10/3/19:
Project almost finished. Shield is not centered.
